# Stopwatch with React

This project is a functional stopwatch created with React and JSX.

## Functionality

- Starts, pauses and restarts the stopwatch.
- Saves timestamps (elapsed seconds).
- Displays a list of saved timestamps.
- Uses `useState`, `useEffect` and `useRef`.

## Goal of the exercise

Learn how to use `useEffect` to control side effects (such as time interval), and how to stop them correctly with `clearInterval`. It also reinforces the use of states in React to handle time and user actions.

## Technologies

- React
- JSX (via Babel)
